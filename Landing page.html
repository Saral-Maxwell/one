                <p>Music is a very important part of our lives.
                     Human souls require music to rejuvenate. It brings peace and harmony to their lives.
                      Without any doubt, we can call music 'the magic of god', 
                      and it is this magic that transforms a mere series of sounds to soulful music.
                      Music is a pleasant sound which is a combination of melodies and harmony and which soothes you.
                     Music may also refer to the art of composing such pleasant sounds with the help of the various musical
                      instruments.
